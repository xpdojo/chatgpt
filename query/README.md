### Q&A

```shell
python3 chatgpt.py -q "What security vulnerabilities are there when AXFR queries are available in DNS?"
```

```shell
1. Data Theft: An attacker can request a zone transfer of a DNS server and gain access to sensitive data such as IP addresses, hostnames, and other information about the domain.

2. DNS Amplification Attacks: An attacker can use an AXFR request to amplify the amount of traffic sent to a target, resulting in a Denial of Service attack.

3. DNS Cache Poisoning: An attacker can use an AXFR request to inject malicious data into the DNS cache, resulting in incorrect information being returned to clients.

4. DNS Spoofing: An attacker can use an AXFR request to spoof DNS records, resulting in clients being redirected to malicious websites.

### Study notes

```shell
python3 chatgpt.py -q "What are 5 key points I should know when studying DNS?"
```

```shell
1. Understand the Domain Name System (DNS) structure and how it works: DNS is a hierarchical system that translates domain names into IP addresses. It consists of a database of domain names and their associated IP addresses.

2. Learn the different types of DNS records: DNS records are used to store information about a domain name. Common types of DNS records include A, MX, CNAME, and TXT records.

3. Become familiar with DNS security best practices: DNS security is important to ensure that your domain name is not vulnerable to attack. Best practices include using DNSSEC and other security measures such as implementing access control lists and limiting DNS query responses.

4. Understand how to troubleshoot DNS issues: Troubleshooting DNS issues can be a complex task. It is important to understand how to identify the source of the problem and how to address it.

5. Learn how to configure DNS: Configuring DNS can be a challenging process, but it is important to understand how to set up DNS records correctly. This includes understanding the different types of DNS records and how to set them up correctly.
